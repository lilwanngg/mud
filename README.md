### MÜD (pronounced mood)

MÜD is an interactive viewing experience for a user and his/her music library. It allows users to link their Spotify's recent listening history to see a visualization that maps each song onto a corresponding point on the graph, based on song characteristics gathered through the Spotify API. Users will then be able to plot different characterstics of the songs onto the y axis, such as valence, danceability, energy, & tempo. In addition to that, recommendations will be displayed on the side to help people discover new music!
