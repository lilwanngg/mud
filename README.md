![wireframe](https://github.com/lilwanngg/jsproject/blob/master/src/assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-08-13%20at%2012.13.02%20AM.png)

MÜD is an interactive viewing experience for a user and his/her music library. It allows users to link their Spotify's recent listening history to see a visualization that maps each song onto a different quadrant of a graph, based on song characteristics gathered through the Spotify API.
(Not completely sure about these yet-->) Users will then be able to plot different characterstics of the songs onto different axes, such as valence, loudness, tempo, etc.

## `MVPS`
* link their own Spotify accounts for personalized listening history
* build 3d chart rendering of a user's listening history
* user's may interact with the chart by changing axis characteristics
* search individual songs for a placement on the chart


## `Development Timeline`
* working with Spotify API to gather data and determine key attributes (1.5 day)
* parse through data for a user's recent history to gather all relevant information (1 day)
* research decide on chart implementation for the visualization using d3.js (3 day)
* add search by song feature (1 day)
